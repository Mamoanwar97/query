## Breaking Changes

v5 is a major version, so there are some breaking changes to be aware of:

### Supports a single signature, one object

useQuery and friends used to have many overloads in TypeScript - different ways how the function can be invoked. Not only this was tough to maintain, type wise, it also required a runtime check to see which type the first and the second parameter, to correctly create options. 

now we Only support the object format

```diff
- useQuery(key, fn, options)
+ useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn, ...options })

- useInfiniteQuery(key, fn, options)
+ useInfiniteQuery({ queryKey, queryFn, ...options })

- useMutation(fn, options)
+ useMutation({ mutationFn, ...options })
```

### The `remove` method has been removed from useQuery

Previously, remove method used to remove the query from the queryCache without informing observers about it. It was best used to remove data imperatively that is no longer needed, e.g. when logging a user out.

But It doesn't make much sense to do this while a query is still active, because it will just trigger a hard loading state with the next re-render.

if you still need to remove a query, you can use `queryClient.removeQueries({queryKey: key})`

```diff
 const queryClient = useQueryClient();
 const query = useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn });

- query.remove()
+ queryClient.removeQueries({ queryKey })
```

### The minimum required TypeScript version is now 4.7

Mainly because an important fix was shipped around type inference. Please see this [TypeScript issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/43371) for more information.
